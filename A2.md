## Authentication (User Authe.)
---
**Note :-** InfoSec : CIA -> Parkerian Hexad (Google it)

**Authe. Factors : KOI**
- **K**nowledge factors : password, PIN, security que. etc.
- **O**wnership factors : wrist band, ID card, HW/SW token etc.
- **I**nherence factors : fingerprint, retina, DNA, sign., face, voice etc,

**Types of Authe. :** (will discuss bold one's)
 - **Password based** - simple cookie based hashing user/pass etc. 
 - Passwordless - nothing but a hype term.
 - MFA (Multifactor auth)
 - Biometric, Captchas
 - Certificate Based (Digital Sign.) - uses SSO
 - Single Sign-On (SSO) - based on cookies 
 - **Token Based :** HTTP Basic, API Key, OAuth/OIDC (JWT)
 
**Types of Authe. Protocol** : Based on stateful & stateless authe. (will discuss bold ones) 
 - **HTTP Autho. Header (Basic Schema)** (Other Schema - Bearer, Digest, HMAC, etc.) - require no cookies, SID, login page etc.
 - **OpenID/OIDC** (on top of OAuth 2.0) - will discuss in Authorization
 - **SAML** (Closely used as alternate to OIDC)
 - **JWT** : JWS/JWE/JWK/JWA
 -  Kerberos
 - LDAP
 - PAP
 - CHAP
 - EAP
 - P2P
 - FIDO2 - UAF, U2F
 - SSL/TLS - Uses public key cryptography - digital certificates
 - AAA architecture protocols :
	 - TACACS, XTACACS and TACACS+
	 - RADIUS (LoginRadius)
	 - DIAMETER
 - Others : Hawk authe, AWS Sign., NTLM, Etc... (See wiki for more)

## Authorization (User Autho./Access Control)
---
**NOTE :** There is no specific type/protocol for authorization. Some are HTTP Autho. & OAuth 2.0/OIDC. We will discuss here only **OAuth 2.0/OIDC**. To delegate Autho. use - Authorization as a Service (Eg. Cerbos) 

**Access Control System (Autho.) Factors :** 
- AAA : Authentication, Authorization, Accountability/Auditing
	- Identity & Access Mgmt. (IAM)
- Other keywords : 
	- Access control List, Access control matrix
	- Authorization OSID (Similar to Authentication OSID)

**Authorization/Access Control Model** : 

**NOTE** : As per OWASP, prefer ABAC & ReBAC over RBAC.
- **RBAC** (Role-Based-Access-Control)
- **ABAC** (Attribute-Based-Access-Control)
- **Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC)**
- Other : 
	- Graph-Based Access Control (GBAC)
	- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
	- History-Based Access Control (HBAC)
	- History-of-Presence Based Access Control (HPBAC)
	- Identity-Based Access Control (IBAC)
	- Lattice-Based Access Control (LBAC)
	- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
	- Organization-Based Access Control (OrBAC) 
	- Rule-Based Access Control (RAC)/Rule-Based Role-Based Access Control (RB-RBAC)
	- Responsibility Based Access Control (RespBAC)
